Once you use that, you won't want to go back to this!\n\n### Features\n\n- Seamless State Sharing (SSS)\n- Global Application Awareness (GAA)\n- Evented Evolution Engine (EEE)\n- Plugin-optimized Operation (POO)\n- Extremely [high performance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bob-Marley-in-Concert_Zurich_05-30-80.jpg)\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n### That for applications\n\nTo start using that, simply:\n\n```bash\n$ npm install --save that\n```\n\nAnd in your application:\n\n```javascript\nvar that = require('that');\n\n// require plugins down here...\n// use that...\n```\n\nBy requiring that, your plugins will share the Global Application Awareness (GAA).\n\nThat's it!\n\n### That for plugins\n\nThat enables easy plugin development via POO and SSS.\n\nIf you're writing a plugin module, you don't even need to install that! In that\ncase, just require that to get that:\n\n```javascript\nvar that = require('that');\n```\n\nThat's Seamless State Sharing (SSS) will take care of the rest (you'll get the\nsame exact that that your application is using).\n\nTo write your plugin, just interact with that!\n\nAPI\n---\n\nThat's Evented Evolution Engine (EEE) is based on the well-tested Node.js core\n[EventEmitter](http://nodejs.org/api/events.html#events_class_events_eventemitter).\nStudy that!\n\nExample application\n-------------------\n\nAn fully-functional, modular website application example is provided\n[here](https://github.com/carlos8f/that.js/tree/master/examples/app).\n\nFAQ\n---\n\n### Is that a joke?\n\nNo! See the [example](https://github.com/carlos8f/that.js/tree/master/examples/app)\nif you don't believe me.\n\n### Do I really need that?\n\nOf course not.\n\n### I've never seen anything quite like that.\n\nNor have I!\n\n- - -\n\n### Developed by [Terra Eclipse](http://www.terraeclipse.com)\nTerra Eclipse, Inc. is a nationally recognized political technology and\nstrategy firm located in Aptos, CA and Washington, D.C.\n\n- - -\n\n### License: MIT\n\n- Copyright (C) 2012 Carlos Rodriguez (http://s8f.org/)\n- Copyright (C) 2012 Terra Eclipse, Inc.
