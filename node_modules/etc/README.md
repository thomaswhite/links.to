node-etc
========

Configuration loader for node.js applications.

Idea
----
Your application probably needs to load configuration from multiple sources and
make them available as one object. Etc is here to help!

Etc provides a fairly complete API for loading configuration from a
variety of sources, however, its been engineered to easily load config from
(in order of precedence): argv, environment, files in `./etc`, package.json, and
 defaults. Etc. also supports a simple plugin system so new file parsers or other
 sources of configuration can be handled.

Etc 0.2.x Changes
-----------------
**Attention Etc 0.1.x Users** - Etc 0.1.x used `proto-list-deep` as its primary
internal configuration store. This was *probably* fast for writes, but as it
turns out the deep-merging going on in `proto-list-deep` (for `conf.get()`) is
pretty slow. I hit a personal use-case where I need reasonably fast `conf.get()`
calls. I tried a few different iterations and came up with 0.2.x, which uses
an object literal to store the conf and uses a combination of `clone` and
`tea-merge` to handle sets and gets.

The API has not changed, however, depending on your specific configuration
**the values of your conf may have changed**. `tea-merge` is much more
intelligent about merging than `proto-list-deep` was, specifically when
dealing with arrays. If you upgrade, please check that your conf is
still merging how you think it should. Thanks!

Here is an idea of the speed-up from 0.1.x:

```

Examples
--------
#### Easy Mode
```js
var conf = require('etc')().all().toJSON();
```

#### Easy Mode done manually
```js
var etc = require('etc')();

etc
  .argv()
  .env()
  .etc()
  .pkg();

var conf = etc.toJSON();
```

#### Load configuration from argv, env, a file, and defaults.
```js
var etc = require('etc')();

etc.argv();
etc.env();
etc.file('/path/to/you/file/config.json');
etc.add({
  my: 'defaults'
});

var conf = etc.toJSON();
```

#### Load configuration from `/etc/myapp/*`
```js
var etc = require('etc')();
etc.folder('/etc/myapp');
var conf = etc.toJSON();
```

#### Work with configuration using deliminated keys
```js
var etc = require('etc')();

etc.add({
  host: 'localhost',
  port: 3000,
  meta: {
    title: 'Cool title'
  }
});

console.log(etc.get('meta:title'));
// Cool title

etc.set('meta:description', 'This is a really cool app');

console.log(etc.get('meta'));
// { title: 'Cool title',
//  description: 'This is a really cool app' }
```

API
---
### require('etc')([delim])
Etc exports a factory function the creates instances of `Etc` objects. You can
optionally specify the key delimiter to use (defaults to ` : `)

### etc.get(key)
Fetch a value from the configuration stack. Keys can be simple strings or
deliminated strings such as `db:host`, which will dive into the configuration
to grab a nested value.

### etc.set(key, value)
Set a new configuration value. The key can be a simple string or a deliminated
string. (Chainable)

### etc.toJSON()
Returns all of the configuration, deep-merged into a single object.

### etc.use(plugin, options)
Attach an etc plugin. See more below. (Chainable)

### etc.all()
Alias for `etc.argv().env().etc().pkg()` (Chainable)

### etc.argv()
Parses argv using [optimist](https://github.com/substack/node-optimist)
and adds it to the configuration. (Chainable)

### etc.env(prefix [app], delim [_])
Adds any environment variables that start with the prefix
(defaults to 'app_') to the configuration. The prefix is stripped from the key.
 (Chainable)

### etc.add(obj)
Add configuration from an object literal. (Chainable)

### etc.file(filePath, [nameed])
Add configuration from a file. A suitable parser must be registered
in etc.parsers ('.json' and '.js' supported by default). If `named` is true
then the extension will be stripped from the filename and the contents will
be added nested under that name.

For example, if your filename is `/path/to/conf/db.json`, then the configuration
will be added like:

```
{
  "db": { [contents of db.json ] }
}

```
(Chainable)

### etc.folder(dir)
Loops through the files in `dir` and adds them to the configuration.
All files will be added with `named=true` (see etc.file()), except for one
special case when the filename is `config.*`. (Chainable)

### etc.pkg()
Try to find the local `package.json` for the consumer of etc and
look for an `etc` key in it. If it exists then add the contents to the
configuration.

Example:
```
{
  "name": "etc-example",
  "description": "Etc example",
  "main": "example.js",
  "dependencies": {
    "etc": "*"
  },
  "etc": {
    "db": {
      "host": "localhost",
      "port": 3000
    }
  }
}
```
(Chainable)

### etc.etc()
Look for `[app root]/etc` (based on location of package.json) and
load it using `etc.folder()`. (Chainable)

### etc.reverse()
By default, each call to etc that adds more configuration pushes it on the
bottom of the stack. If you wish to unshift conf onto the top of the stack
instead you can call `etc.reverse()` followed by any other etc commands.
Until you call `etc.reverse()` again all subsequent etc methods will continue
to unshift.

Plugins
-------
Etc supports a simple plugin system, primarily useful for adding new file
parsers. Plugins should implement an `attach` method like so:

```js
exports.attach = function(options) {
  options = options || {};

  // Plugin will be attached with the scope set to an etc instance.
  var etc = this;

  etc.parsers['xml'] = xmlparser;
}

function xmlparser(filePath) {
  // Parse the file and return an object literal.
}
```

### etc-yaml
Support for YAML configuration files can be added via [etc-yaml](https://github.com/cpsubrian/node-etc-yaml).
```js
var etc = require('etc'),
    path = require('path'),
    conf = etc();

conf.use(require('etc-yaml'));

// Load a yaml file.
conf.file(path.join(__dirname, 'config.yaml'));

// Print the config.
console.log(conf.toJSON());
```

### etc-redis
Coming soon
